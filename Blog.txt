1.Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 :

HTTP1
->Ithe usest works on the textual format.
->There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
->It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
->It compresses data by itself.

HTTP2
->It works on the binary protocol.
->It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
->It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
->It uses HPACK for data compression.
->HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.

2.objects and its internal representation in Javascript :

    Objects in JavaScript are data structures that allow you to store multiple values as properties. They are essential for organizing and structuring data in the language. In this blog post, we will delve into the internal representation of objects in JavaScript, which will help you understand how objects work under the hood.

When an object is created in JavaScript, the JavaScript engine creates an internal representation of the object in memory. This internal representation is called an object-intern. The object-intern contains information about the object’s properties, methods, and prototypes.
